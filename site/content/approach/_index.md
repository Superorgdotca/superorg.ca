Superorganism is a design and innovation collective that helps visionary organizations create clearer, more ambitious strategies to make different worlds possible.

We help communities, organizations, and enterprises working toward just, sustainable, and common futures. 

We design with you to deeply understand the needs and desires of those you serve, to imagine what different worlds are possible, and to orient your present work within this context. 

We do this through our seven entangled practices of visioning, foresight, strategy, research, systems thinking, facilitation, and evaluation:
