We've been thinking about how we introduce ourselves as designers and talk about our work for a while now, and first presented our thoughts and prototyped some activities at the [Relating Systems Thinking and Design Symposium](https://www.superorg.ca/work/introducing-yourself-as-a-systemic-designer/) in Chicago in October 2019. Dan happened to be in attendance at that session and that's how we got invited down to CMU. Dan Lockton and Silvana Juri hosted us as part of their undergraduate [Persuasion course](http://persuasion.imaginari.es/).

Tara was able to be there in-person, and Ariana joined remotely which worked out better than we expected! We're going to be writing more about the workshop and our activites soon, but if you want to have a look at what we did at CMU, you can check out our slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C_xWRoD6vi6ldWhhbBdYxoXM5Rt2Y6lwUvCAHcOLYi8/edit?usp=sharing) and read the description of our activities below.

## Standard Introductions

We had everyone pair up and introduce themselves as they would in a professional setting. Afterwards we collected the categories of information that they included in their introduction and had Ariana introduce herself using their template. After that we had a discussion about what they still wanted to hear from her.

## Verbing the Introduction

We then introduced the idea of talking about what you do by describing it through verbs instead of through nouns, like "designer." We introduced ourselves in this manner and the students then wrote down their own verb descriptions and put those up on the wall for everyone to look at.

We had this idea after Ariana discovered this quote from Stephen Fry:

> Oscar Wilde said that if you know what you want to be, then you inevitably become it – that is your punishment, but if you never know, then you can be anything. There is a truth to that. We are not nouns, we are verbs. I am not a thing – an actor, a writer – I am a person who does things – I write, I act – and I never know what I am going to do next. I think you can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun.

Using nouns can constrain an understanding of what it is that you do, and they can also be confusing and not all that descriptive.

Finally, we went through several frames for thinking about introductions in different ways. We started to develop these at RSD8 last October, and prototyped this activity there as well. We descriped each frame and introduced ourselves in that way, and then had the students try some of the frames out themselves as well.
