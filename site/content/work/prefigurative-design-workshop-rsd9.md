Prefigurative design is a way of working toward societal change by embodying the ideals of the future you want in your practice. We were inspired by and have learned from social movements employing prefigurative politics. We believe that anyone can use prefigurative design as a framework for thinking about what type of future their own practices (whether personal or professional) prefigure. As we build our own practice, prefigurative design has helped us clarify and align on our desired future and ways to begin manifesting that future in the ways we work.

We hadd over 60 attendees engage in our activities.
