RSD community includes systems thinkers and designers from different sectors, countries, perspectives. Wanted to use activity group as opportunity to source something that would be helpful to us, that these people might have an interesting perspective on, that could help them too. Started with designing with care: principles-based design using our thesis. What we’ve really been working on since our thesis though is not designing with the principles themselves but how to get started in our own practice as designers (with care). How do we describe the work we do? Especially since the work is complex and systemic, it involves terms like design that mean different things to different people, it involves many people and discipline who might all come in with different levels of understanding and different vocabularies.
