  Talking about what we do can be challenging, for so many reasons. But
  introductions present crucial opportunities to invite people into our work, to
  find new collaborators, to have interesting conversations, and to showcase the
  most compelling and meaningful parts of what we do and why we do it.

The following materials were designed to be used in a facilitated workshops on designing your introductions. They can be used to think through how you might think differently about your own introduction, and can be used individually, with a partner, or with your organization. We would love to hear about your experience using these materials; please send us your thoughts!
