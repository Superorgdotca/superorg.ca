**Virtual Mending Circle**

Come chat with us for our first Virtual Mending Circle! Wednesday, March 25 at 6pm EST at this [Zoom](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/884843792).

Things feel really broken right now. Next Wednesday, we’re hosting an online hangout to chat and mend our things, our systems, ourselves, and each other.

**What will it look like?**

This is our first experiment with publicly opening up our conversations. We’re planning to structure the call similarly to our regular chats with each other. We’ll set an agenda of things we might want to talk about that everyone can see (and contribute to) before the call, and we’ll take turns sharing and discussing. All kinds of participation will be welcome; if you just want to listen to us chat and relax, we’re here for you!

**Where does the mending come in?**

We will be mending our physical things! Ariana is going to fix her backpack and some clothes, Tara has some buttons she needs to reattach, so feel free to bring something you want to fix. We’ll talk through what we’re working on and give each other tips if we have them (Tara recently learned to darn and Ariana’s partner James needs to fix his favourite socks, so we can do some virtual learning). Mending can look like so many things, repairing, tidying, organizing, cleaning, stretching, breathing, sketching, and if you don’t have anything you want to work on this call, that’s okay too!

**How do I participate?**

Check out our agenda here; please feel free to add anything beforehand. The call will be hosted on Zoom at this [link](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/884843792). We’ll be reachable by email if there are any questions or issues connecting.

**If I can’t make this one, will there be more?**

Yes! We’re hoping to host one every month, so stay tuned, and please let us know if you’re interested.
