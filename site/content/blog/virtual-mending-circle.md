Things feel really broken right now. Next Wednesday, we’re hosting an online hangout & chat to mend our things, our systems, our selves, and each other.

**What will it look like?**

This is our first experiment with publicly opening up our conversations. We’re planning to structure the call  similarly to our regular chats with each other. We’ll set an agenda of things we might want to talk about that everyone can see (and contribute to!) before the call, and we’ll take turns sharing and discussing.

**Where does the mending come in?**

We will be mending our physical things! Ariana is going to fix her backpack and some clothes, Tara XYZ, so feel free to bring something you want to fix to the call with you. We’ll talk through what we’re working on and give each other tips if we have them (Tara recently learned to darn and Ariana’s partner James needs to fix his favourite socks, so we can do some virtual learning!). Mending can look like so many things, EXAMPLES, and if you don’t have anything you want to work on this call, that’s okay too!

**What will we talk about?**

The theme of this call is mending our systems, our selves, and each other. Given the state of the world right now, there should be no shortage of conversational directions, and we’ll give some structure in our meeting agenda. MORE HERE?

**How do I participate?**

We will share our agenda here starting here; please feel free to add anything beforehand. The call will be hosted on XYZ. Please RSVP beforehand! We’ll be reachable by email if there are any questions or issues connecting.

**If I can’t make this one, will there be more?**

Yes! We’re hoping to host one every month, so stay tuned, and please let us know if you’re interested.

**What if I don’t have something to say?**

We bet you do, but listening is great too :-)
